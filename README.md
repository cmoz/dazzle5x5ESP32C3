# dazzle5x5ESP32C3
Code for the 01Space ESP32-C3 to display messages, that you can type into your phone or device
Walk through with what the project does: https://youtu.be/8e2qXAOdp-A 

This is such a small board it makes for a FANTASTIC board to use in wearable / fashion technology projects. In this video, I take a close look at the code, and we learn about ARRAYS too. The code does some pretty fun stuff. It connects to wifi, and then you can search for the IP address of the board, and loading it will launch a webpage. From there, we can send a message to the board, which will be displayed as text, and we can also change the colours too. 

I hope you have as much fun editing the code as I did! 

We will also build a project with the board that you can follow - and we will already have the code!

_________________________

This code has two files, the font file is where the array defines the appearance of the characters. All of this can be altered; you can add other characters or change the appearance of the ones in the file. The code was written on the PlatformIO add on for visual studio, but the code can be copied to an arduino sketch and it will still work without changes. 

The .cpp file contents can be copied and pasted into the Arduino IDE sketch.
